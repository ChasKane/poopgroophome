This is a simple contact manager made for POOSD -- the Processes of Object Oriented Software Development class at UCF.

### backend
Written in golang, there is a Go file per API end point. We implemented custom sessioning. Hashing and salting of passwords was done using a Go dependency. Database is a local MySQL file. MySQL must be installed using default settings on the server this runs on.

### frontend
All of the frontend was written in one file, index.html. It uses standard HTML and JS to provide basic contact app interactions.

### jank
We learnes a ton during this 2 week project, and in the next 8 weeks, we'll be learning even more. Test driven development, continuous integration, A JS library or two, or perhaps even an entire framework like Angular would be excellent. we're still experimenting with what workflows work best for our team :)
